# Problem 22: Names scores
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=22
#
# Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
# alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical
# position in the list to obtain a name score.
#
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
# worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
# would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
#
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

ALPHABET = [

    'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'
]
ALPHA_VALUE = dict(zip(ALPHABET, range(1, 27)))

with open('../_files/p022.txt') as f:
    names = f.read().split(',')
    names = sorted(names)

total_score = 0
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    s = name[1:-1]
    score = 0
    for ch in s:
        score += ALPHA_VALUE[ch]
    score *= (i + 1)
    total_score += score

print(total_score)
